## Developing

To develop locally, clone the repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.

Then, start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

To create a deploy build of the app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

Then, run: 

```sh
npm run deploy
```
